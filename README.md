# monkeys
My take at the infinite monkey theorem.

I'm writing this in several langauge to both learn those languages and improve my ability to write OO code.

Updates:
----
Changing folders around, all js is now is "node" and a new folder for DOM related html + JS.
Creating html-js/monkeys000.html

monkey-js/monkeys003.js:
Putting the code through JLINT and seeing how much I can clean it up, then will start to refactor parts that need it, and try to DRY up the code more.

monkey-js/monkeys002.js:
Now that I've tested out OO syntax, time to try to use it better. Correcting errors and changing to prototype syntax. Bug fix: entire alphabet was not being used for guesses making short strings faster to match. Also adding a loop to print out what string subset (discovered) has been found so far. 


monkey-js/monkeys001.js: first stab at objects in js
monkey-js/monkeys.js: Translation of monkeys.rb to js
monkey-rb/monkeys.rb: Original code
