My take at the infinite monkey theorem.

I'm writing this in several langauge to both learn those languages and improve my ability to write OO code.

Updates:
----
monkey-js/monkeys002.js:
Now that I've tested out OO syntax, time to try to use it better. Correcting errors and changing to prototype syntax. Bug fix: entire alphabet was not being used for guesses making short strings faster to match.


monkey-js/monkeys001.js: first stab at objects in js
monkey-js/monkeys.js: Translation of monkeys.rb to js
monkey-rb/monkeys.rb: Original code
